            <p class="pink-box-paragraph">Hazelnuts are among the most popular nut crops in Georgia and is major export agricultural commodity.  Currently the majority of hazelnuts commercially produced in Georgia come from Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Guria, Imereti and Kakheti Regions. Hazelnuts play an important role in the Georgian agricultural sector. Georgia is the one of the largest producers of hazelnuts in the world – after Turkey, Italy, USA and Azerbaijan, meeting around 4-5% of worldwide demand.

            <p class="middle-paragraph">In Georgia, the projected outlook for the hazelnut industry is promising, with significant opportunities for new growth in emerging and traditional markets. Hazelnuts are typically sold as an ingredient of traditional Georgian cuisine: a snack item, for use in confectionary industry, cereals and baked goods. In addition, industry or non-industry supported research shows that hazelnut consumption provides unique health <a href="#" class="midle-paragraph-link">benefits and nutritional value</a> and is a good source of different vitamins, fibers and antioxidants. The development of this sub-sector represents significant upside potential for Georgian producers and processors and will increase opportunities to export.
